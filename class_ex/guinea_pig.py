"""
Expand on the class GuineaPig:
    1. Add following attributes: color, age, weight
    2. Add method jump and return true if the pig jumps. Pigs weighted above 2 lbs
        can't jump.
    3. Add appropriate dunder methods so that you can use comparision operators
    (<, >, =) with them.
    4. Can you retrofit the class so we can add 2 guinea pigs to make a super pig?
